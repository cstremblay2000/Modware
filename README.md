# Modware
This project was developed for the 2255 CSEC-741-01 Internet of Things Security calss of the Spring 2022 semester. 

Our project seeks to develop an unobtrusive client/server middleware solution that enables secure communication without intrusive modifications to the existing hardware or extensive time investment for integration. Recognizing that the data transmitted by Modbus devices is intrinsically insecure, our middleware is strategically designed to be positioned in close proximity to the devices, preferably on the same switch or even in line. This approach minimizes the duration of unencrypted traffic, significantly reducing the window of vulnerability.

A core objective of our project is to address the security challenges inherent in legacy and resource-constrained industrial systems, which often lack the capacity to support advanced cryptographic processes. By implementing this middleware solution, we strive to offer a seamless yet robust layer of protection for these systems without disrupting their normal operations.

Furthermore, our project aims to facilitate the adoption of secure communication practices in various industrial settings by offering a cost-effective and easily deployable solution. This middleware can be scaled across different environments, making it a versatile security enhancement for a wide range of industrial control systems that rely on protocols with limited built-in security measures.

Ultimately, our research endeavors to contribute to the broader understanding of cybersecurity in industrial contexts, while providing practical solutions for organizations seeking to bolster their security infrastructure without significant disruption or financial burden.
